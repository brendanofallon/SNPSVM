SNPSVM 
------
Pronounced "snip ess-vee-ehmmm",  SNPSVM is a support vector machine based method for identifying sequence variants in next-gen sequencing data. It takes as input a BAM-formatted alignment of sequencing reads, and emits a VCF formatted describing where all the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are. At least, that's the idea. 
 SNPSVM is in the early stages of development, but can be used to produce a list of variant calls. Work is ongoing, so expect some bugs and lots of changes.
